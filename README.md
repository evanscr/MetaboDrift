)# MetaboDrift
MetaboDrift is a macro-enabled Excel worksheet for metabolomics data (or other LC-MS data) post-processing that enables within-batch intensity drift correction and between-batch signal level normalization.  Several methods for intensity drift-correction or between-batch intensity normalization are enabled in MetaboDrift, including QC/reference-sample curve-fitting based drift correction (quadratic, cubic splines or LOESS), total or median signal intensity normalization, and internal standard intensity normalization.  Instructions for use of MetaboDrift are provided on the first tab of the Excel worksheet.  A more detailed description of intensity drift correction in metabolomics and on the operation and application of MetaboDrift can be found in the following reference:
