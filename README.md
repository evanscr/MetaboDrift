# MetaboDrift
MetaboDrift is a macro-enabled Excel worksheet for metabolomics (or other LC-MS data) post-processing that enables within-batch intensity drift correction and between-batch signal level normalization.  Several methods for intensity drift-correction or between-batch intensity normalization are enabled in MetaboDrift, including QC/reference-sample curve-fitting based drift correction, total or median signal intensity normalization, and internal standard intensity normalization.  Instructions are provided on the first tab of the Excel worksheet.  A more detailed description of intensity drift correction in metabolomics can be found in the following reference:
